EPS climbing back to the throne 
Minister of charge with violating election rules espivelumani #ADMK
Let us all hope that for the sake of TN and India is least # TNElection2021 would throw up if hung assembly does not get reelected Admk
"Edappadi Palanisamy formed an alliance wit #PMK & gave10.5% reservation ""Temporarily"" to win his own constituency. '"
The newspaper marketing campaign by all major newspapers across Admk is kinda good this morning. Someone realised that there s a world outside the digital realm :)
Rule 140 etappatiyar confirmed seat ... ..
Thumbs up DMKLosingTN Sureshot These type of Tamilnadu will be safe from DMK confirms talks before their defeat counting
"Delta was the concern for me, but reports suggest Admk by excellent performance in delta. Will not be surprised if a sweep into turns."
"Duraisamy Ravindhran is a good man, he has personally taken this poll, and hence that he is doing an expert should not be vociferous. Abusing him is not right. As far as I m concerned, I have my own ears to the ground and I do believe he will be proved wrong. Admk wins."
"TN government administration has provided excellent. That s why people like me want to come again this government. TN's performance is rarely highlighted in media because, Regional media is DMK controlled, National media has contempt, for ADMK, being a BJP ally."
"Many are underestimating the #AIADMK, by saying they may not even cross 50 seats. The same was said during the 2016 election. Many criticized us when we predicted 136 for ADMK in 2016, But we were right. So never underestimate anyone. # TNElection2021"
second priority will be to put in order the finances of the state government which has the ADMK left in utter shambles - I will ensure that a thorough review is done and the findings and shared with the people of TN are plans to restore it.
The appearance of white containers in at odd hours has centres not counting three BJP or ADMK one bit rattled.
Again a state in alliance with BJP ruled ADMK. Hopefully it will 2 after election results may change on
During pandemic Admk Govt. 6 months free ration for all people to gave. My prediction Admk 150+.
Would Admk comfortably by itself form the govt. It would not require the support of allies
ADMK crores spent 7+ pan India and third in the list. (ADMK spent crores through 62+ govt ads listed under which this is not)
Till 2011 they are spot on. But 2016 they meet Kalaignar after elections. After officials where those came ADMK sidelined. So officials are not ready to take sides
"I m placing EPS comfortably ahead in this election, do not be surprised if a wave in its favor of the cm. Stay confident."
"I'm saying ""never underestimate anyone"". It does not mean that ADMK will again form government."
"Vanniyar votes 40% to 60% have 80 constituencies .. this equal to 80,000 to 1,40,000 votes in per constituency..70% of vanniyar votes transferred to Admk alliance .."
"Modi will just escape and will push centre established in the name of all blames state. In his own Varanasi, impact of covid Pathetic is ruled by BJP CM and PM. Who will he blame from people seeing or just cover to build the crematorium wall."
"TN did not waste any act of vaccine because by central government, even more inefficient and wasted Oh then the vaccines ADMK government is simply no reason for?"
Dmk delta for more than Admk did. Do not know why ppl that do not realise
Emergence of a new leader in place of amma has erased a bit of the anti incumbency feeling that actually existed. Whereas only reinstating the anti incumbency feeling is mamta presence.
I agree. But the fact is behind ADMK EPS did not rally enough. Its purely an internal issue & clear lack of intent. EPS personally feel I deserved what he got a much better image than build-up.
Mudslinging is ADMK collapsed once and for all. So vigilance report is rubbish and does not work out?
Lockdown is needed now to restrictions with maximum vaccinate people. I think they knew the Admk government coz they are thinking of not going to let it go again win. They are trying to escalate this until May 2 it seems.
They already ruled and also they have good manifesto
Need a change in present rule
Since people will not vote differently Jayalalitha passed away
May be because the current government has lost the trust amongst the public and the other is next majority party
According to circumstances he may not have the chances to win in this election.
EPS performed well in last 2 years taking everyone by surprise.
BJP in elections for fear of failure - AIADMK coalition staged maneuvers'
giving promises in all constituencies are eaders each day. What were they doing all these 10years ?? Hatching eggs ?? Now they are expecting people to trust them and vote again ??
"ADMK is ready to sell themselves, party & everything to BJP."
Credit succeed in Tamil Nadu
"950 rupees to 100 rupees per cylinder gasoline feet ..... buying any woman any man will not vote for the BJP, AIADMK. # VoteForDMKalliance # TNElection2021 # TNElections2021 # DMK4TN #AdmkFails"
The slave will send home rule
".. South teykiratu that dwell in the north of the current best example of Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK-BJP alliance will help young people be deceived!"
Admk on Bjp fear of losing the elections and their drama started. # TNElections2021 # TNAssemblyElections2021 #NoVoteToBJP #AdmkFails
Srirangam near Musiri AIADMK candidate and sitting MLA Rs 1 crore cash seized from the car belonging to Selvaraj

Atimukavinar payments to voters across the state ..
Amid intense pressure generated valuable as the diamond head EPS
"During this covid, no political party would handle the situation too properly, even thought with the back bone of central government, some internal actions are done by their own, and too other political party or political have not done anything to their own party members, NAAM TAMIZHAR guys and this too, I could only see them during this election timings and for opposing the ruling party what ever works,"
